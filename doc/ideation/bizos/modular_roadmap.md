## Tiered Roadmap: Core + Modules

### **Phase 1: Core Product (MVP)**
**Goal:** Build a universal foundation that works across niches.
- Entity Registry (LLCs, Corps, Trusts)
- Ownership Graph (people, equity stakes, beneficiaries)
- Document Vault (basic secure storage)
- Calendar + Reminders (filings, renewals, obligations)
- Light Reporting (net worth snapshots, cash flow roll-up)

> Market fit: Broad appeal — small operators with 2–10 entities.

### **Phase 2: First Modules (Beachhead Niches)**
**Goal:** Tailor to underserved entry markets with clear spreadsheet pain.

1. **Governance Module**
   - Auto-generated board minutes & resolutions
   - Compliance workflows by state
   - Board/shareholder voting
   - **Market:** Solo founders, small LLC owners

2. **Founder / Startup Module**
   - Cap table modeling (SAFEs, notes, equity grants)
   - Dilution and exit scenarios
   - Export to Carta/Pulley
   - **Market:** Pre-Carta founders, accelerators

3. **Real Estate / Operator Module**
   - QuickBooks Online consolidation
   - Intercompany eliminations
   - Cash flow scenario modeling (refinance, sale)
   - **Market:** Small landlords, holding companies

---

### **Phase 3: Expansion Modules**
**Goal:** Broaden use cases to capture family office / emerging wealth segment.

4. **Family Office / Emerging Wealth Module**
   - Net worth dashboard across personal + entity holdings
   - Insurance, estate, collectibles, domain/IP tracking
   - Advisor collaboration (CPA, attorney)

5. **Integration Layer Module**
   - Sync data across QBO, Carta, DocuSign, Dropbox, Google Drive
   - API for custom workflows
   - **Market:** Power users, consultants, accountants

---

### **Phase 4: Platform Depth**
**Goal:** Move from tool to operating system.

- Advanced Scenario Planning (cross-entity “what-if” analysis)
- Consolidated Multi-Entity Financial Statements
- Audit & Compliance Logs
- Role-Based Access (family members, advisors, employees)
- Marketplace for add-ons (estate templates, tax tools, third-party integrations)

---

### **Sequencing Rationale**
- **Phase 1:** Establish the common backbone (entities + reminders).
- **Phase 2:** Go after clear wedges with high pain (governance filings, pre-Carta cap tables, landlord consolidations).
- **Phase 3:** Expand into higher-value segments (emerging family office, integrations).
- **Phase 4:** Build platform depth for retention, network effects, and upselling.

---

⚡ **Guiding Insight:** Every module should feel like a natural extension of the core — solving one spreadsheet pain at a time, until the platform becomes the de facto "OS for ownership and entities."
